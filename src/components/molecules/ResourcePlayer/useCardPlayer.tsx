 * no Play on in its action row:
 * - A link that is itself on a service with a player (`getOwnPlayer`: a Spotify artist page, a

 *   the card's image and text.
 * - A generic link (MusicBrainz, Wikipedia, Discogs, an article) shows our card up front (`isCard`),
 *   the services Pinakes knows it on (Also on) in the switch below Card.
 * - One service only, the link's own: its player alone, no switch and no Card. A viewer who wants
 *   cards turns "Show platform embeds up front" off (Settings, Links & Media).
 * - Several services: the link's own first, then the others; Card is always in the switch.
 * - The viewer's Players (Settings, Links & Media) still apply: services in the viewer's order go
 *   first (no order set: the link's own first, then Pinakes' order), removed ones are left out (a
 *   link whose own service is removed counts as generic), and Card (no player) above a link's first
 *   service shows the card. The default is no order.
 *
 * A pick switches in place, paused; what played stops. A player plays only on a press inside it
 * (never on mount or scroll); once it plays it is the page's one player and docks at the bottom of
 * the screen when its card scrolls away (`PlayerDock`). With platform embeds up front off, a
 * stand-in loads nothing from the services until its Play is pressed.
 *
 * @param card - The card shown, or `null` (nothing to play: a link's own preview, a pending card)
 * @param href - The link as written, played first when it is on such a service
 * @param surface - What the action row sits on (`ResourceActions`' `surface`): `default` on the resource page
