 * post's own footer (`ResourceActions`: tags, actions and a ⋯ menu that copies the link and the
 * title). A card on other services too (`also_on`) lists them in the ⋯ menu under "Also on".
 * A card that is pending or failed and has no name says less than the link's own preview, and a
 * failed read, or one slower than `PINAKES_SLOW_READ_MS` until it is read, is treated like an
 * unknown link (no error box and no long skeleton in a feed).
 *
 * Inside a quoted or reposted post (`PostPreviewCard`) the card has no action row or tag bar, as
 * while composing: that post is itself a link (or sits in the Reply/Repost dialog), so controls
 * there would nest in it. People act on the link where its own post renders.
 *
 * Without a Pinakes origin configured no request is made and the plain `GenericPreview` renders,
 * as before; a direct media file keeps it too, since it shows or plays the file inline.
 *
 * A card on a service that allows embedding plays there in place (`useCardPlayer`: "Play on
 * <service>" in the action row, a dock when it scrolls away); not in the composer or a quoted post.
 *
 * A link Pinakes does not know yet (a post published seconds ago) is read again while the preview
 * is on screen (`usePinakesCard`'s `recheck`), and its card replaces the link's own preview in the
 * same box once Pinakes has read it, with no loading state in between. In the composer, Pinakes is
 * asked to read such a link right away (`resolve`) instead of re-reading it, so the published post
 * shows its card at once, and still has its own re-reads if Pinakes had not read it yet. Outside
 * the composer the box grows smoothly to the card (`AnimatedHeight`).
